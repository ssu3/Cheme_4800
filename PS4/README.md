####Objective
*In Problem Set 4, we are tasked with taking a large dataset, `Synthetic-Numerical-CoV-10K-Fibrinolysis-NoMLabels.csv`, which holds clinical trial information regarding patients who are pregnant and reducing its size by computing the first two principal components from the standardized data array.
