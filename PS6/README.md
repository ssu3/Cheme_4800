## Problem Set 6: Computing the Maximum Theoretical Growth Rate of _E.coli_

In Problem Set 6, we will compute the maximum theoretical growth rate of E. coli, an organism that is widely used in industry. We will utilize a JSON file, specifically `e_coli_core.json`, which contains the stoichiometric array of E. coli, to extract certain pieces of information to build a list of metabolites, reactions, upper and lower bound arrays for each reaction, and lastly, a stoichiometric matrix. This will be done in order to solve the linear programming problem.
