## Problem Set 5: Estimating kinetic parameters from experimental data

The purpose of Problem Set 5 was to utilize experimentally recorded data of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction in order to determine two unknown parameters: the maximum reaction velocity, $V_{max}$ , and the Michaelis-Menten constant, $K_{M}\$. An input matrix and output matrix were created to represent the inverse of S, the substrate concentration and the inverse of v, the rate of reaction, respectively. From this, it was found that ${\beta_{1}}$= $K_{M}\$/ $V_{max}$ = .0028923 and ${\beta_{2}}$ =1/ $V_{max}$ = .379258. After, the normal distribution for error in y-output, $\frac{1}{v}$ was found to be N{5.893x10^-17,.005556}. Finally, a normal distribution was found for the two unknown parameters, where ${\beta_{1}}$ ~N\{.00283529,.000377561} and ${\beta_{2}}$ ~N\{0.379258, .00136625} when n sample size was 50,000.
