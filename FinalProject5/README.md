## Objective: 
In Problem Set 2, we will utilize the chemical reaction database [KEGG database](https://www.kegg.jp). We will design a program that takes the molecular formulas listed in the database and generates the elements of each molecule as a dictionary key and its respective subscript as a dictionary value.
