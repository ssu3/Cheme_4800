## Problem Set 7: Utility in a Binomial Lattice Option Pricing Calculation
The purpose of Problem Set 7 was to utilize the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (RSS) binomial lattice model for the pricing of American option contracts as it is a data programming solution to uncertain choice problems. Problem Set 7 allows us to discern that a contract priced using a utility choice has the same price as a pure money choice once the utility function U(x) becomes independent of x, shown by PV1=4.025 and PV2=4.018 when b=50,000.
